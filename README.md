Cultivating Change: Data Insights on Agrifood Emissions
Project Background
This project analyzes data related to agrifood emissions, aiming to provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, producers, and consumers to adopt more sustainable practices. The study covers:

The environmental impact of different agricultural activities and food production processes.
Data-driven insights to encourage greener practices within the agrifood sector.
The analysis provides insights and recommendations on the following key areas:

CO2 Emissions & Population Trends – Examining the link between global CO₂ emissions, temperature rise, and urbanization.
Major and Minor CO2 Emitters – Identifying the countries and factors contributing most to emissions.
Forestland & Fire-Related Emissions – Assessing deforestation and wildfire-related carbon emissions.
Barriers to CO2 Reduction & Solutions – Exploring economic, policy, and behavioral challenges along with mitigation strategies.
The exploratory data analysis used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found here.

Data Structure & Initial Checks
The dataset utilized in this project consists of one main table with 31 columns, covering agrifood emissions, population trends, temperature shifts, and forest area data. The primary data sources include FAO and climate research databases.
